              <strong style="font-size: 2rem; border-bottom: #362823 solid 1px;">Here is a timeline of Tim Ferris's life:</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1977</strong> - Born 6 weeks premature and given a 10%
              chance of living. I survive instead and grow so fat that I can’t
              roll onto my stomach. A muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me
              look in opposite directions, and my mother refers to me
              affectionately as “tuna fish.” So far so good.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1983</strong> - Nearly fail kindergarten because I refuse
              to learn the alphabet. My teacher refuses to explain why I should
              learn it, opting instead for “I’m the teacher—that’s why.” I tell
              her that’s stupid and ask her to leave me alone so I can focus on
              drawing sharks. She sends me to the “bad table” instead and makes
              me eat a bar of soap. Disdain for authority begins.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1991</strong> - My first job. Ah, the memories. I’m hired
              for minimum wage as the cleaner at an ice cream parlor and quickly
              realize that the big boss’s methods duplicate effort. I do it my
              way, finish in one hour instead of eight, and spend the rest of
              the time reading kung-fu magazines and practicing karate kicks
              outside. I am fired in a record three days, left with the parting
              comment, “Maybe someday you’ll understand the value of hard work.”
              It seems I still don’t.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1993</strong> - I volunteer for a one-year exchange
              program in Japan, where people work themselves to death—a
              phenomenon called karooshi—and are said to want to be Shinto when
              born, Christian when married, and Buddhist when they die. I
              conclude that most people are really confused about life. One
              evening, intending to ask my host mother to wake me the next
              morning (okosu), I ask her to violently rape me (okasu). She is
              very confused.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1996</strong> - I manage to slip undetected into
              Princeton, despite SAT scores 40% lower than the average and my
              high school admissions counselor telling me to be more
              “realistic.” I conclude I’m just not good at reality. I major in
              neuroscience and then switch to East Asian studies to avoid
              putting printer jacks on cat heads.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1997</strong> - Millionaire time! I create an audiobook
              called How I Beat the Ivy League, use all my money from three
              summer jobs to manufacture 500 tapes, and proceed to sell exactly
              none. I will allow my mother to throw them out only in 2006, just
              nine years of denial later. Such is the joy of baseless
              overconfidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1998</strong> - After four shot-putters kick a friend’s
              head in, I quit bouncing, the highestpaying job on campus, and
              develop a speed-reading seminar. I plaster campus with hundreds of
              god-awful neon green flyers that read, “triple your reading speed
              in 3 hours!” and prototypical Princeton students proceed to write
              “bullsh*t” on every single one. I sell 32 spots at $50 each for
              the 3-hour event, and $533 per hour convinces me that finding a
              market before designing a product is smarter than the reverse. Two
              months later, I’m bored to tears of speed-reading and close up
              shop. I hate services and need a product to ship.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fall 1998</strong> - A huge thesis dispute and the acute
              fear of becoming an investment banker drive me to commit academic
              suicide and inform the registrar that I am quitting school until
              further notice. My dad is convinced that I’ll never go back, and
              I’m convinced that my life is over. My mom thinks it’s no big deal
              and that there is no need to be a drama queen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spring 1999</strong> - In three months, I accept and quit
              jobs as a curriculum designer at Berlitz, the world’s largest
              publisher of foreign-language materials, and as an analyst at a
              three-person political asylum research firm. Naturally, I then fly
              to Taiwan to create a gym chain out of thin air and get shut down
              by Triads, Chinese mafia. I return to the U.S. defeated and decide
              to learn kickboxing, winning the national championship four weeks
              later with the ugliest and most unorthodox style ever witnessed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fall 2000</strong> - Confidence restored and thesis
              completely undone, I return to Princeton. My life does not end,
              and it seems the yearlong delay has worked out in my favor.
              Twenty-somethings now have David Koresh–like abilities. My friend
              sells a company for $450 million, and I decide to head west to
              sunny California to make my billions. Despite the hottest job
              market in the history of the world, I manage to go jobless until
              three months after graduation, when I pull out my trump card and
              send one start-up CEO 32 consecutive e-mails. He finally gives in
              and puts me in sales.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Spring 2001</strong> - TrueSAN Networks has gone from a
              15-person nobody to the “number one privately held data storage
              company” (how is that measured?) with 150 employees (what are they
              all doing?). I am ordered by a newly appointed sales director to
              “start with A” in the phone book and dial for dollars. I ask him
              in the most tactful way possible why we are doing it like retards.
              He says, “Because I say so.” Not a good start.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fall 2001</strong> - After a year of 12-hour days, I find
              out that I’m the second-lowest-paid person in the company aside
              from the receptionist. I resort to aggressively surfing the web
              full-time. One afternoon, having run out of obscene video clips to
              forward, I investigate how hard it would be to start a sports
              nutrition company. Turns out that you can outsource everything
              from manufacturing to ad design. Two weeks and $5,000 of credit
              card debt later, I have my first batch in production and a live
              website. Good thing, too, as I’m fired exactly one week later.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2002-2003</strong> - BrainQUICKEN LLC has taken off, and
              I’m now making more than $40K per month instead of $40K per year.
              The only problem is that I hate life and now work 12-hour-plus
              days 7 days a week. Kinda painted myself into a corner. I take a
              one-week “vacation” to Florence, Italy, with my family and spend
              10 hours a day in an Internet café freaking out. Sh*t balls. I
              begin teaching Princeton students how to build “successful” (i.e.,
              profitable) companies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Winter 2004</strong> - The impossible happens and I’m
              approached by an infomercial production company and an Israeli
              conglomerate (huh?) interested in buying my baby BrainQUICKEN. I
              simplify, eliminate, and otherwise clean house to make myself
              expendable. Miraculously, BQ doesn’t fall apart, but both deals
              do. Back to Groundhog Day. Soon thereafter, both companies attempt
              to replicate my product and lose millions of dollars.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>June 2004</strong> - I decide that, even if my company
              implodes, I need to escape before I go Howard Hughes. I turn
              everything upside down and—backpack in hand—go to JFK Airport in
              New York City, buying the first one-way ticket to Europe I can
              find. I land in London and intend to continue on to Spain for four
              weeks of recharging my batteries before returning to the salt
              mines. I start my relaxation by promptly having a nervous
              breakdown the first morning.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>2004–2005</strong> - Four weeks turn into eight, and I
              decide to stay overseas indefinitely for a final exam in
              automation and experimental living, limiting e-mail to one hour
              each Monday morning. As soon as I remove myself as a bottleneck,
              profits increase 40%. What on earth do you do when you no longer
              have work as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big
              questions? Be terrified and hold on to your ass with both hands,
              apparently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>September 2006 </strong> - return to the U.S. in an odd,
              Zen-like state after methodically destroying all of my assumptions
              about what can and cannot be done. “Drug Dealing for Fun and
              Profit” has evolved into a class on ideal lifestyle design. The
              new message is simple: I’ve seen the promised land, and there is
              good news. You can have it all.
